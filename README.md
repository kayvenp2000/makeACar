# makeACarChallenge
## What was the challenge?
The challenge was to us everything we learned about typescript to make a program that would take in four inputs the user gave us: the color of the car, the car type, the number of doors on the car, and the number of miles per gallon the car would hold.
## The Steps/Instructions
The first thing the code does is in the HTML file it takes four inputs. One thing I thought about was what would someone do if they wrote the numbers as words instead of numbers as integers. Then the next step is to collect what the user has inputed and put in an object, this is done in the typescript file. The next thing to do was to put the information given into a class so it can be assigned values and so that it can work regardless of what the input is.
